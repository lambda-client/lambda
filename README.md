## Looking for maintainers. 

Please check [dominika's](https://github.com/dominikaaaa) profile for contact methods. 

Due to this project rapidly expanding we're in need of Kotlin maintainers who can review pull requests and preferably have experience working with either Minecraft / Forge or GL before.
